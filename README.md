# Core Engine

The Core Engine is a C++ framework based on the SDL library for **Windows, Linux and Android games.** It's currently under initial development and gets re-written from old code, some of the features already implemented are listed below.

This project is focused on creating a **supportive framework for fast and simple development** of multimedia applications and games, with the personal intention to learn new stuff and to have a structured coding base (core) for other projects.

> - **System:** Window and Event Handling, Timer, Threads 
> - **Graphics:** Camera and View Frustum Control, Ambient and Lighting Control, Frame Buffers, Models (.md5), Textures, Shaders, Fonts
> - **Audio:** Sound Effects (.wav), Music Files (.ogg), Music Player
> - **Input:** Mouse, Keyboard, Joysticks/Gamepads 
> - **Math:** Vectors (2d, 3d, 4d/Quaternions), Matrices (3x3, 4x4), Splines
> - **Data:** String/Stream Manipulation, Random Numbers, Fast-Lookup Container
> - Asynchronous Resource Management
