# Core Engine

The Core Engine is an extensive C++ framework based on the SDL library, currently for **Windows, Linux and Android games** and compatible with **OpenGL (ES) 2.x, 3.x and 4.x capable hardware**.

This project is still in early development, but it already provides a wide range of tools and features, solid performance, high stability, easy setup and well-written code with regular updates. It is **designed to be supportive, versatile and powerful**, and to dynamically use efficient fallback methods where specific system features are not available.
